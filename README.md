# Emergency Department Dashboard

A React-based operational dashboard for emergency departments. It visualizes patients, encounters, vitals, critical alerts, KPIs, turnaround times, and more. Optional FHIR integration enables live data; mock data supports offline development.

## Quick Start

- Requirements: Node.js 16+, npm 8+, modern browser
- Install: `npm install`
- Start: `npm start` â†’ http://localhost:3000
- Test: `npm test`
- Build: `npm run build`

## Documentation

- Developer Guide: `docs/Developer-Guide.md`
- Integration Guide (FHIR, DB/Mock, AI, performance): `docs/Integration-Guide.md`
- Changelog: `CHANGELOG.md`

## Notes

- FHIR is optional. The app falls back to mock data when no server is configured.
- SMART-on-FHIR configuration can be provided in `src/services/fhirClient.js` (see Integration Guide).
